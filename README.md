# Desk Defense
Everything is due today.

To play this game, download and run DeskDefense.exe.

This game is not finished. I still need to add speed-changing buttons, sounds, more visual effects, make the UI look better, add more supply types, more homework types, and balance the different supply types.

This game is 100% action-free, RNG-free, treasure-free, dialog-free, win-condition-free, sidequest-free, permadeath-free, and projectile-free. 

Software used: Unity, GitHub, Visual Studio, Notepad++, Paint, Incompetech, YTMP3, Audacity, Voice Recorder, Roblox

Soundtrack: Impending Boom, Moonlight ( https://www.yourclassical.org/story/2017/06/15/daily-download-ludwig-van-beethoven--piano-sonata-no-14-moonlight-i-adagio-sostenuto )

This game is mostly inspired by the original Bloons Tower Defense. 

Just so you know, I don't do my big projects the night before they're due. I usually do them the DAY before they're due.
