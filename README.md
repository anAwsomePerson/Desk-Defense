# Desk Defense
Everything is due today.

To play this game, download the whole project and run Desk-Defense.exe. You don't need to download the gitignore and README if you don't want to.

This game is 100% action-free, RNG-free, treasure-free, dialog-free, win-condition-free, sidequest-free, permadeath-free, and projectile-free. 

Software used: Unity, GitHub, Visual Studio, Notepad++, Paint, YTMP3, Audacity, Voice Recorder, Roblox

This game is mostly inspired by the original Bloons Tower Defense. 

Just so you know, I don't do my big projects the night before they're due. I usually do them the DAY before they're due.
