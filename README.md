# Desk Defense
Everything is due today.

To play this game, download the project, open the folder for your operating system, and run the application file in that folder.

I also made comics that are not very related to this game, but I still want you to click this link and read them: https://tapas.io/series/drawn-curtains/info

This game is 100% action-free, RNG-free, treasure-free, character-free, win-condition-free, sidequest-free, permadeath-free, and projectile-free. 

The source code is here: https://github.com/sumwun1/Develop-Desk-Defense

Software used: Unity, GitHub, Visual Studio, Notepad++, Paint, YTMP3, Audacity, Roblox

This game is mostly inspired by the original Bloons Tower Defense and my desire to build a machine that does all my homework for me.
